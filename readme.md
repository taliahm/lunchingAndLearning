## Fullstack

<details>
<summary>What is fullstack development?</summary>
<br>
The practice of writing code that starts with what the user sees and interacts with (the UI), and goes all the way through the server to the database level of the application.

<summary>What is a database?</summary>
<br>
A place to permanently store data.

<details>
<summary>What is a server?</summary>
<br>
A computer that is always running that knows how to handle requests from other computers and responds to them.

## Code Along
Setup steps:
- Clone this repo
- `npm install`
- In your terminal run `node server.js`

We will be coding in `server.js` and `index.html`. The final code is in `server-end.js` and `completed.html`. 

There is no hot reloading! You have to kill the server and restart if you want your changes to appear:
In your terminal:
- `ctrl + c` (kills the server)
- `node server.js` (runs the server again)

Tech used:
- Node
- Express JS, a framework on top of Node
- Axios (using a CDN in index.html)
- HTML/CSS!

This is my recommendation, everyone has a different journey and will have different opinions so ask around!

What to start with:
Build a full stack app with Express server, firebase realtime database and React front end. These are very approachable technologies some of which you will learn in the bootcamp!

Look into other databases: MongoDB, Firebase cloud storage are great places to start. Postgres/MySQL have a steeper learning curve but if you are already familiar with SQL, go for it!

Look into other languages: Ruby on Rails, Python are lovely and simliar to JS
